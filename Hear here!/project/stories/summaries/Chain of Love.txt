A brilliant short story focussing on kindness and unconditional love expressed to 
the ones in need. Once a man helps a woman fix her flat tire on a long road and does 
not accept any money in return. Instead he wishes this chain of love to be kept 
extending to others. What he does not know is, what is in store once he reaches his home.
