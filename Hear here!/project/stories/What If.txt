What if 
these empty roads, the closed gates, the quarantine centres become permanent.

What if after some time we adapt to this life,
anti social becomes the new fad , 
every new year becomes a lost hope , 
we loose the track of time and the calendar becomes nothing but a worthless piece of paper.

What if 
we start hating being out in the sun , 
what if we become unsure of the existence of human life in our neighbourhood.
What if we stop talking because the silence around becomes euphoric and we do not want a caesura to the melody,
what if we stop talking because we are too afraid to get a reply.

What if you become athirst to talk to anyone who can but when you see someone the first thing you do is hide just to make sure you keep breathing .
What if every night you hear death rattles around you,
 people crying and screaming, knocking on doors but you are too afraid to go open the doors just to make sure you keep breathing .

What if this is a prologue to the denouement human life, what if this is the traceback train and the next stop is hunters and gatherers with extinction being the terminus.

What if you do keep breathing,
but only you.
