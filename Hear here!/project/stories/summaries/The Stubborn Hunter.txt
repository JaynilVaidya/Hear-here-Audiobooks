This is one of the best moral stories for kids. It is based on the fact that killing
innocent animals is considered worse than a sin. The protagonist is a hunter who has a 
knack of hunting helpless animals, especially rabbits in the forest. But even though he 
receives warnings before a normal hunting session, he doesn't stop and faces the consequences.
